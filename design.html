			<h2>Design</h2>
			<p>
				Keep the rythm and dance movement going, 'cause we're bringing to you <b>DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION</b>! We've brought back everyone's facorite arcade game, accessible in a polished and easy to play mode. Play our web game, with our homebrew pad or your handy-dandy keyboard.
			</p>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>We all love groovn' n' movin', so we wanted to make a DDR game that integratesa web component
			and mechanical/electrical board. We were inspired by the original DDR game, and wanted to add a
			web element so that people could play it without a TV available. In addition, we were really interested
			in creating an engaging and structurally-sound dance board that people could dance and jump on.</p>
			<h3>Project Goals</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Successful software, mechanical and electrical integration to create a responsive DDR game
						from board to website!</li>
					<li>The mechanical board supports human weight and house electrical wires and arduino</li>
					<li>Pressure sensors calibrated and synced with our web game</li>
					<li>Aesthetically pleasing and interactive board and web game</li>
					<li>Document our process and integrationa</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>System Diagram</h3>
			<img width="100%" src="images/systemDiagram.png"/>
			<p>In short, our system functions as follows: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>The website sends the board data through the arduino serialport. This data includes which step should be stepped
				on next (in 3 seconds). The LEDs of that step light up a blue color.</li>
				<li>An arrow that matches the step starts floating up on the website</li>
				<li>After 3 seconds, the arrow should match the top arrows, and if the step is correctly stepped on at that time,
					data will be extracted from the pressure sensor and will indicate that it's been stepped on.
					If stepped on correctly, the LEDs turn green for that moment, but if the step has not been correctly stepped on, the LEDs turn red.
				</li>
				<li>The website also updates the score to take into account the score increase or deduction.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
			<p>None of us comes from a mechanical background, so we wanted to challenge ourselves to build a
			wooden and structurally-sound board that would require us to understand materials and the
			process of fabricating different components, utilizing the capabilities of the machine shop. In addition,
			we were excited to learn and think through the different systems integration that we would have to do to:
			house the electrical components with the mechanical board, and communicate between the different electrical
			components and a website. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Bill's Learning Goals:</p>
			<p>Casey's Learning Goals: Understand how electronics work in theory, as well as in real life. The complexities that
			go into electronics (twisting of wires and electromagnetic waves,..) are really interesting and necessary when building
			circuits in real life.</p>
			<p>Cynthia's Learning Goals: Learn about integrating web development capabilities with electrical components,
			as well as challenge myself to learn how to think through mechanical designs.</p>
			<p>Nora's Learning Goals:</p>
