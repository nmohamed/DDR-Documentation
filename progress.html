			<h2>Sprint Reviews</h2>
			<p>
				Interested in how we progressed through this project? Below you can find details about how <b>POE DDR</b> came to be! Sprints were 2 weeks each
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Sprint 1</h2>
			<p>
				Team DDR has been formed! 

				Good feel: We wanted a DDR mat that felt solid and good to step on. This led us to make the board out of wood (MDF) instead of making a cloth pad.
				Modular: Since the board would probably be heavy, we wanted to make sure that you could easily 

				Cynthia started to explore on web game designs. We decided to implement Web packages such as Phaser to make our web component. She built a simple website that implements the basics of our DDR game. Cynthia and Casey also worked on the communication between Arduino and web. We connected a 4-button strip to the Arduino, and integrated the Arduino with web, and finally we were able to identify and show which button is pressed on the website.

			<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
			<p>
				Keep the rythm and dance movement going, 'cause we're bringing to you <b>DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION</b>! We've brought back everyone's facorite arcade game, accessible in a polished and easy to play mode. Play our web game, with our homebrew pad or your handy-dandy keyboard.

				We continued working on the website, and improved the UI design. By integrating a LED with the Arduino and our website, we were able to lit up the LED in different colors to show whether the player pressed the correct button at the correct time.

			<h2>Sprint 3</h2>

				Keep the rythm and dance movement going, 'cause we're bringing to you <b>DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION</b>! We've brought back everyone's facorite arcade game, accessible in a polished and easy to play mode. Play our web game, with our homebrew pad or your handy-dandy keyboard.

				We kept our website design, and Cynthia implemented Heroku App on the website which enabled us to create apps and connect databases. She also put a playable song on the website which syncs with the game.
