			<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
			<p>None of us comes from a mechanical background, so we wanted to challenge ourselves to build a
			wooden and structurally-sound board that would require us to understand materials and the
			process of fabricating different components, utilizing the capabilities of the machine shop. In addition,
			we were excited to learn and think through the different systems integration that we would have to do to:
			house the electrical components with the mechanical board, and communicate between the different electrical
			components and a website. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Bill's Learning Goals: </p>
			<p>Casey's Learning Goals: Understand how electronics work in theory, as well as in real life. The complexities that
			go into electronics (twisting of wires and electromagnetic waves,..) are really interesting and necessary when building
			circuits in real life.</p>
			<p>Cynthia's Learning Goals: Learn about integrating web development capabilities with electrical components,
			as well as challenge myself to learn how to think through mechanical designs.</p>
			<p>Nora's Learning Goals: Learn about mechanical design and the fabrication process.</p>

			<h2>Sprint Reviews</h2>
			<p>
				Interested in how we progressed through this project? Below you can find details about how <b>POE DDR</b> came to be! Sprints were 2 weeks each
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Sprint 1</h2>
			<p>
				Team DDR has been formed!

				Good feel: We wanted a DDR mat that felt solid and good to step on. This led us to make the board out of wood (MDF) instead of making a cloth pad.
				Modular: Since the board would probably be heavy, we wanted to make sure that you could easily move and disassemble the board.

				During sprint 1, we started to explore different web game designs for DDR, as well as web packages for game graphics. We decided to implement web
				package such as Phaser to make our web component, but then realized that we really just wanted an animation package for javascript, so we went with
				GreenSock (GSAP). We designed and made initial MVP web pages that implements the basics of our DDR game.
				In addition, we started working on the communication between Arduino and web through the Node.js package called Serialport.
				We connected a 4-button strip to the Arduino, and integrated the Arduino with web, and finally we were able to identify and show which button is
				pressed on the website. In terms of mechanical work, we came up with the idea of creating pieces that connect through dovetail joints, in addition
				we decided to go with polycarbonate to cover our LEDs and MDF with springs.

			<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
			<p>
				Keep the rythm and dance movement going, 'cause we're bringing to you <b>DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION</b>! We've brought back everyone's facorite arcade game, accessible in a polished and easy to play mode. Play our web game, with our homebrew pad or your handy-dandy keyboard.
